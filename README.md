# RL_Circuit
Experimental determination of the inductance of a coil, using an Arduino board.
The repository contains the Arduino IDE sketch (rl_circuit.ino) and the Python scripts used in the processes of data acquisition (data_acquisition.py) and data processing (data_fit.py). 
"Charge1_x" files are ten samples measurements of the charge of the circuit, given an equivalent resistance of 45.08 Ohm.
